\section{Introduction to Affective Computing}
According to Picard \cite{picard:affective-computing}, the term affective
computing encapsulates a new approach in Artificial Intelligence, to build
computers that show human affection. Studies show that the decision making of
humans is not always logical \cite{GrossbergGutowski:affect-cognition}, and in
fact, not only is pure logic not enough to model human intelligence, but it also
shows failures when applied in artificial intelligence systems
\cite{dreyfus:artificial-critique}. Emotions impact fundamental parts of
cognition including perception, memory, attention and reasoning
\cite{clore:judgement-regulation}. This impact is caused by the information
emotions carry about the environment and event values.

Emotions are involved in developing social context. Brian Parkinson in
\cite{parkinson:emotions-social} argues that many of the causes of emotions are
interpersonal and communicative rather than internal and reactive phenomena.
Beside the fact that social context can cause eliciting emotions in individuals,
social context provides information about what emotion should be expressed, by
whom, and in what situations. Humans are emotional and social beings. Their
emotions and the social context in which they are involved have mutual impacts
on each other. But, what if humans can share their emotions with others just as
they share their thoughts, resources and their environment. Sharing an emotion
with others may alter the experience of an event. 

Emotions can also play the role of a motivator in a social context. Humans need
to communicate their emotions within the social context for different reasons.
Although emotions undeniably have personal aspects, they are usually experienced
in a social context and acquire their significance in relation to this context
\cite{parkinson:emotion-social-interaction}. A successful and effective
emotional communication necessitates ongoing reciprocal adjustments between
interactants that can happen by interpreting each other's behaviors
\cite{parkinson:emotion-social-interaction}. It not only requires proper
interpretation of the other's expressions, but also correct assessment of the
extent to which others can read an individual's expressions. In emotional
communication, individuals are constantly exchanging messages about their mental
states, and modifying each other's emotional responses as they occur. One aspect
of expressing and communicating emotion in a social context is to express one's
social motives and intentions \cite{hess:darwin-emotion}. Another aspect of
communicating emotions is to reveal the underlying mental states of an
individual \cite{parkinson:emotion-communication}. In other words, emotions
constitute two different functionalities of expressing communicative signals
associated with one's social motives and intentions as well as expressing one's
internal states and how one feels about something. 

If we want the robots and virtual agents to be more believable and efficient
partners for the humans, we require to consider the personal and social
functionalities and characteristics of emotions for our robots to coexist with
humans as emotional beings. There are several major emotion theories some of
which have corresponding computational models. Modeling and applying these
theories can help the robots and virtual agents to achieve communicative,
evaluative and regulatory aspects of emotions, as I mentioned above. This
document provides major computational emotion theories as well as the related
psychological background. In Section \ref{sec:emotion-theories}, I review the
existing influential computational emotion theories. In this section, I also
provide the underlying psychological theories. Some of these theories provide
structure of emotions and some of them describe the underlying processes of
emotions and their antecedents. Section \ref{sec:comparison} provides
similarities and differences between these major emotion theories. Then, in
Section \ref{sec:applications}, I talk about how these emotion theories have
been applied to build autonomous agents and robots. And finally, in Section
\ref{sec:conclusion}, I provide a brief conclusioin about the artificial
emotions, emotion theories.

\section{Computational Theories of Emotion/Affect}
\label{sec:emotion-theories}

There are different types of computational theories of emotion. These theories
differ in type of relationships between their components and whether a
particular component play a cricual role in an individual emotion. For instance,
the basic component of an emotion can be the behavioral tendencies, cognitive
elements, or somatic processes. Emotion theories can also differ based on their
representationial distinction.

\subsection{Appraisal Theory}
\label{sec:appraisal-theory}

Appraisal theories of emotion were first formulated by Arnold
\cite{arnold:emotion-personality} and Lazarus \cite{lazarus:emotion-adaptation}
and then were actively developed in the early 80s by Ellsworth and Scherer and
their students \cite{roseman:appraisal-theory}
\cite{sander:systems-approach-appraisal} \cite{scherer:nature-function-emotion}
\cite{scherer:appraisal-processes} \cite{scherer:emotions-emergent}. The
emotional experience is the experience of a particular situation
\cite{frijda:emotions}. Appraisal theory describes the cognitive process by
which an individual evaluates the situation in the environment with respect to
the individual's well-being and triggers emotions to control internal changes
and external actions.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
  \center
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figure/cpm.png}
  \caption{Schematic View of the Componential Theory of Emotion
  \cite{hudlicka:guidelines-emotions}.}
  \label{fig:cpm}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Componential approach}
\label{sec:componential-theories}

This approach emphasizes the distinct components of emotions, and is often
called the \textit{componential} appraoch \cite{leventhal:emotion-cognition}.
The ``components" referred to in this approach are the components of the
cognitive appraisal process. These are referred to as \textit{appraisal
variables}, and include \textit{novelty, valence, goal relevance, goal
congruence}, and \textit{coping abilities}
(further on, in this section, some of the appraisal variables used in
computational models are introduced)
\cite{scherer:nature-function-emotion,scherer:appraisal-processes}. A stimulus,
whether real or imagined, is analyzed in terms of its meaning and consequences
for the agent, to determine the affective reaction. The analysis involves
assigning specific values to the appraisal variables. Once the appraisal
variable values are determined by the organism’s evaluative processes, the
resulting vector is mapped onto a particular emotion, within the n-dimensional
space defined by the n appraisal variables. The semantic primitives for
representing emotions within this model are thus these individual appraisal
variables. Figure \ref{fig:cpm} shows the relationship of the individual
appraisal dimensions to the broader categories of evaluations taking place
during appraisal (Relevance, Implications, etc.).

\subsubsection{Component Process Model}
\label{sec:cpm}

The Component Process Model (CPM) is Scherer's influential and major theory of
emotions
\cite{scherer:sequential-appraisal-process,scherer:appraisal-processes}. This
theory focuses on the dynamic unfolding of emotions. The CPM suggests that an
event and its consequences are appraised with a set of criteria on multiple
levels of processing (the appraisal component). The result of the appraisal will
generally have a motivational effect, often changing or modifying the
motivational state before the occurrence of the event. Based on the appraisal
results and the motivational changes, some effects will occur in the autonomic
and somatic nervous system. The CPM considers emotions as the synchronisation of
many different cognitive and physiological components. Emotions are identified
with the overall process whereby low level cognitive appraisals, in particular
the processing of relevance, trigger bodily reactions, behaviours and subjective
feelings. The model suggests that there are four major appraisal objectives to
adaptively react to a salient event \cite{scherer:dynamic-architecture-emotion}: 

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
  \item \textbf{Relevance:} How relevant is this event for the agent? Does it
  directly affect the agent or its social reference group?
  \item \textbf{Implications:} What are the implications or consequences of this
  event and how do they affect agent's well-being and its immediate or long-term
  goals?
  \item \textbf{Coping Potential:} How well can the agent cope with or adjust to
  these consequences?
  \item \textbf{Normative Significance:} What is the significance of this event
  for the agent's self-concept and for social norms and values?
\end{enumerate}

To attain these objectives, the agent evaluates the event and its consequences
on a number of criteria or \textit{Stimulus Evaluation Checks} (SECs), with the
results reflecting the agent’s subjective assessment of consequences and
implications on a background of personal needs, goals, and values
\cite{scherer:appraisal-processes}. Figure \ref{fig:comp-cpm} shows the
postulated sequence, the cognitive and motivational inputs and the effects on
response systems. Also, the bidirectional effects between appraisal and other
cognitive functions are illustrated by the arrows in the upper part of Figure
\ref{fig:comp-cpm}.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
  \center
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figure/comprehensive-CPM.png}
  \caption{Comprehensive illustration of the CPM of emotion
  \cite{scherer:dynamic-architecture-emotion,scherer:appraisal-processes}.}
  \label{fig:comp-cpm}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Appraisal Process}
\label{sec:appraisal-process}

According to this theory, appraisals are separable antecedents of emotion, that
is, the individual first evaluates the environment and then feels an appropriate
emotion \cite{scherer:appraisal-processes}. The appraisal procedure begins with
the evaluation process of the environment according to the internalized goals
and is based on systematic assessment of several elements
\cite{scherer:sequential-appraisal-process}. The outcome of this process
triggers the appropriate emotions. In many versions of the appraisal theory,
appraisals also trigger cognitive responses often called \textit{coping
strategies}. In fact, the coping mechanism manages the individual's action with
respect to the individual's emotional state and the existing internal and/or
external demands \cite{folkman:coping-pitfalls-promise}. The large majority of
computational models of emotions are based on this theory. An individual can
also use knowledge about the emotional reactions of others to make inferences
about them. According to the appraisal patterns, different emotions can be
experienced and expressed. Since expression of emotions reflects one's
intentions through the appraisal process, the \textit{reverse appraisal}
mechanism helps one to infer other's mental states based on their expressions.
\cite{gratch:reverse-appraisal, hareli:emotional-reaction-perception}.

Appraisal process is typically viewed as the cause of emotion and the cognitive
and behavioral changes associated with emotion. For instance, which particular
pattern of the appraisal variables (i.e., individual judgements) would elicit
certain emotion or an emotional expressions. These appraisal variables
include \cite{marsella:ema-process-model}:\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Relevance:} A relevant event has non-zero utility for an agent.
  This relevancy can either be based on negative influence of an event on the
  agent or a positive one.
  
  \item \textbf{Perspective:} The point of vierw in which an event will be
  judged, e.g. self or other.
  
  \item \textbf{Desirability:} A desirable event advances a state of the utility
  for an agent whose perspective is being taken, or inhibits that.
  
  \item \textbf{Likelihood:} A measure of likelihood of the outcome.
  
  \item \textbf{Expectedness:} The extent to which the truth value of a state
  could have been predicted from causal interpretation.
  
  \item \textbf{Causal Attribution:} The agent who desreves the credit/blame.
  
  \item \textbf{Controllability:} Whether the outcome can be altered by the
  agent whose perspective is taken (this variable is related to coping process).
  
  \item \textbf{Changeability:} Whether the outcome can be altered by some other
  causal agent (this variable is related to coping process).
\end{itemize}

Another key process invilved in appraisal is the coping process. This process
determines whether and how the agent shoud respond with respect to the outcome
of the appraising the events. There are several coping strategies that
computational models like EMA \cite{gratch:domain-independent} use as control
signals. These control signals enable or suppress the cognitive processes that
operate on the causal interpretation of the appraisal patterns. Coping process
controls the congruency of the acitons according to these patterns. As it is
shown below, in \cite{gratch:domain-independent} coping strategies are organized
into two categories of \textit{problem-focused} and \textit{emotion-focused}
coping strategies. Problem-focused coping strategies can be applied when the
agent requires to do something with respect to the problem, whereas
Emotion-focused coping works by changing one's interpretation of circumstances.
The following is a short list of a broad range of coping strategies
\cite{gratch:domain-independent}:

\begin{description}
  \item[Problem-focused coping] \hfill
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item \textbf{Active coping:} Taking active steps to remove or circumvent the
	  stressor,
	  \item \textbf{Planning:} Coming up w/ action strategies,
	  \item \textbf{Seeking social support for instrumental reasons:} Seeking
	  advice, assistance, or information.
	\end{itemize}
  \item[Emotion-focused coping] \hfill
    \begin{itemize}
	  \item \textbf{Seeking social support for instrumental reasons:} Getting
	  sympathy, moral support or understanding,
	  \item \textbf{Acceptance:} Accepting the stressor and learn to live with it,
	  \item \textbf{Restraint coping:} Waiting till the appropriate opportunity
	  (holding back).
	\end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{OCC, a Structural Appraisal Theory of Emotion}

OCC model, similar to Lazarus' \cite{lazarus:cognitive-theory-emotion} and
Scherer's \cite{scherer:nature-function-emotion} cognitive views, considers
emotions to arise from affective or valenced reactions subsequent to the
appraisal of a stimulus as being beneficial or harmful to one’s concern
\cite{occ:structure}. The model categorizes emotions based on their underlying
appraisal patterns. These patterns are fundamental criteria a person employs for
evaluating the situation. They involve the person’s focus of attention, their
concern, and their appraisal preceding an affective reaction. Figure
\ref{fig:occ-model} shows main building blocks of OCC model.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
  \center
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figure/occ.png}
  \caption{A simple visualization of OCC model \cite{occ:structure}.}
  \label{fig:occ-model}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:occ-model}, a person could alternatively have three
types of focuses. These types of focuses are consequence of events, actions of
agents, and aspects of objects. The person evaluates the significance of causes
behind these three types of focuses based on her personal concern. As a
result, an affective reaction will be elicited resulting in an emotion. Various
combinations of the elements depicted in Figure \ref{fig:occ-model} create
specific patterns demonstrating six main groups of emotions in which all emotion
types in a group share the same cognitive pattern. Emotion groups are
\textit{fortune-of-others, prospect-based, well-being, attribution,
well-being/attribution- compound}, and \textit{attraction}. The OCC model
introduces 22 emotion types. These emotions are introduced each as a
representative of a family of similar emotions with various intensities
(since relying on a list of discrete emotions that is understood by everyone
equally is impossible due to people's language barriers and various
interpretations of the actual words). For instance, happyness can be referred to
by other emotion terms such as joy, cheerful, glad, delighted while they all
share the same eliciting conditions. Thus the emotion types used in the model
(e.g., relief, love, pride, and shame) are meant to represent an emotional
experience rather than a lexical taxonomy.

Fo instance, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:occ-model}, the appraisal criterion for
consequences of event’s is their \textit{desirability} (see Section
\ref{sec:appraisal-theory}) for achieving one’s goals. This generates the
affective reaction of being \textit{pleased} in possitive cases, or
\textit{displeased} in negative ones. Figure \ref{fig:occ-structure} shows the
resulting emotion groups in OCC model such as \textit{fortune-of-others} (e.g.,
gloating, pity), \textit{prospect- based} (e.g., satisfaction, relief), and
\textit{well-being} (e.g., joy, distress) \cite{occ:structure}. The appraisal of
the praiseworthiness of the actions of an agent against one's personal
standards, as well as the appealing aspects of objects happens in the same way
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:occ-model}.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
  \center
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure/occ-structure.jpg}
  \caption{OCC taxonomy of emotion triggers and emotions \cite{occ:structure}.}
  \label{fig:occ-structure}
\end{figure}

Finally, the OCC model introduces some global variables of emotions intensity to
distinguish all types of emotions that a person could experience when
encountering events, agents or objects. These variables are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sense of reality (representing the degree to which the event, agent or
	object in focus appear real to the person),

	\item Proximity variable (representing the psychological proximity of event,
	agent or object),

	\item Unexpectedness (representing how unexpectedly one is taken by surprise,
	either positive or negative),

	\item Arousal (representing how arousing an event, agent or object is).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Constructivist (dimensional) emotion Theories}
\label{sec:dimensional-emotions}

The components and dimensions of emotions were the subject of much speculation
since the 19th century. Dimensional models of emotion attempt to conceptualize
human emotions by defining where they lie in two or three dimensions.
Dimensional theories of emotion argue that emotion should be conceptualized, as
points in a continuous (typically two or three) dimensional space rather than
looking at them as discrete entities (see Section \ref{sec:discrete-emotions})
\cite{carver:affect-behavior} \cite{mehrabian-russell:pad}
\cite{russell:core-affect} \cite{watson:consensual-structure-mood}. 

\begin{figure}[tbh]
  \center
  \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{figure/core-affect.png}
  \caption{Core affect \cite{russell:core-affect}.}
  \label{fig:core-affect}
\end{figure}

Two dimensions that are commonly proposed to describe emotions are valence and
physiological arousal \cite{arnold:emotion-personality}
\cite{lazarus:cognitive-theory-emotion} \cite{russell:circumplex-affect}. Models
based on dimensional theories contrast theories of basic emotion, which propose
that different emotions arise from separate neural systems
\cite{posner:circumplex-affect}. Many dimensional theories argue that discrete
emotion categories (e.g., sadness, fear and anger) have no ``reality'' in that
there are no specific brain regions or functions that correspond to specific
emotions \cite{barrett:emotions-natural}. Dimensional theories do not emphasize
the term emotion.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
  \center
  \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{figure/dimensional2.png}
  \caption{Three dimensional model of pleasure, arousal and dominance as
  tripartite view of experience \cite{mehrabian:pad}.}
  \label{fig:pad}
\end{figure}

One of the two-dimensional models that are most prominent is Russell's
circumplex model \cite{russell:circumplex-affect}. Russell suggested that
affective states are all related to each other systematically through what is
called core affect \cite{russell:circumplex-affect,russell:core-affect} (see
Figure \ref{fig:core-affect}) and emotions are best described as a change in
core affect which, in turn, is describable as a point in a space between two
bipolar dimensions. One dimension is \textit{valence} or how good or bad are
objects and events for a being ranging from pleasant to unpleasant. The other
dimension is \textit{arousal}, ranging from calm to excited. Russell put a
number of affective states around a circular space between those two dimensions
(see Figure \ref{fig:core-affect}) which is also known as \textit{circumplex},
representing the variety of core affects
\cite{russell:circumplex-affect,russell:core-affect}. Since sometimes
two-dimensional space cannot easily differentiate among emotions that share the
same values of arousal and valence, e.g., anger and fear (both characterized by
high arousal and negative valence), some of the dimensional models incorporate
valence and arousal as well as \textit{intensity}, or \textit{dominance}
or stance dimensions. Many computational dimensional models build on the three
dimensional “PAD” model of Mehrabian and Russell \cite{mehrabian-russell:pad}
where these dimensions correspond to pleasure (a measure of valence), arousal
(indicating the level of affective activation) and dominance (a measure of power
or control). Figure \ref{fig:pad} shows these three dimensions.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
  \center
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{figure/basic-emotions.jpg}
  \caption{Basic emotions and corresponding expressions.}
  \label{fig:basic-emotions}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Basic (discrete) emotion theories}
\label{sec:discrete-emotions}

Basic emotion theories are inspired by Tomkins' \cite{tomkins:affect}
rediscovery of Darwin's work
\cite{darwin:emotion-expression,hess:darwin-emotion} which later were developed
by Ekamn \cite{ekman:argument-emotions} and Izard \cite{izard:human-emotions}.
These theories emphasize a small set of discrete and fundamental emotions.
The underlying assumption of this approach is that these emotions are mediated
by associated neural circuitry, with hardwired component
\cite{ekman:argument-emotions}. Different emotions are then characterized by
stable patterns of triggers, behavioral expression, and associated distinct
subjective experiences. The emotions addressed by these theories are typically
called the \textit{basic} emotions. Emotions including happiness, sadness, fear,
anger, surprise, and disgust are often considered to comprise the most
prototypical basic emotions \cite{ekman:argument-emotions}. The theory of basic
emotions holds that there is a set of emotions shared by all humans that evolved
to deal with ancestral life challenges \cite{ekman:argument-emotions}. For
instance, disgust evolved to deal with the challenge of avoiding noxious
stimuli, and fear evolved to deal with the challenge of avoiding dangers.
Because of the emphasis on discrete categories of states, this approach is also
termed the \textit{categorical} approach \cite{panskepp:affective-neuroscience}.
Much of the supporting evidence offered for the theory comes from experiments
that show how certain facial expressions are universally associated with
specific basic emotions, regardless of the observer's cultural background. This
universality has a production side and a recognition side. On the production
side, a particular emotional state is said to elicit a facial expression
comprised of a fixed set of facial muscles. On the recognition side, observers
are able to infer the emotional state of the person who expresses an emotion,
due to the direct correspondence between emotional states and the facial
expressions they cause. Computational models inspired by the basic emotions or
discrete approach often focus on low-level perceptual-motor tasks and encode a
two-process view of emotion that argues for a fast, automatic, undifferentiated
emotional response and a slower, more differentiated response that relies on
higher level reasoning processes (e.g.,
\cite{armony:computational-modeling-emotion}).

\subsection{Other Approaches}

There are other approaches that different researchers take based on their
emphsis on the applicability of emotions in their systems.

\subsubsection{Rational Approaches}

Rational approaches start from the question of what adaptive function does
emotion serve and then attempt to incorporate these functions into a model of
intelligence. Emotion, within this approach, is simply another set of processes
and constraints that have adaptive value. Models of this sort are most naturally
directed towards the goal of improving theories of machine intelligence
\cite{anderson:newell-cognition} \cite{scheutz:affect-agent}
\cite{simon:motivation-emotion-cognition}.

\subsubsection{Communicative Approaches}

Communicative theories of emotion argue that emotion processes function as a
communicative system. They can function first, as a mechanism for informing
other individuals of one’s mental state (thereby facilitate social
coordination), and second, as a mechanism for requesting/demanding changes in
the behavior of others. Communicative theories emphasize the
social-communicative function of expressions \cite{gratch:emotion-intention}.
Computational models inspired by communicative theories focus on machinery that
decides when an emotional expression can have a desirable effect on a human
counterpart.

\section{Similarities and Differences}
\label{sec:comparison}

Different theoretical perspectives should not be viewed as competing for a
single ground truth. They should be seen as distinct perspectives, each arising
from a particular research area (e.g., biological vs. social psychology),
focusing on different sets of affective phenomena, considering distinct levels
of resolution and fundamental components (e.g., emotions vs. appraisal variables
as the distinct primitives). These different perspectives also provide different
degrees of support for the distinct processes of emotion, e.g., the componential
theories provide extensive details about cognitive appraisals
\cite{hudlicka:guidelines-emotions}. Therefore, I am going to provide a
pairwise comparison between these fundamental theories.

\subsection{Dimensional Vs. Discrete (Basic) Emotion Theories}

The fundamental assumption of the basic emotion theory is that a specific type
of event triggers a specific affect programme corresponding to one of the basic
emotions and producing characteristic expression patterns and physiological
response configurations \cite{scherer:emotions-emergent}. Dimensional theory's
main criticism of basic emotions theory is based on the observation that
affective phenomena appear to be both qualitatively and quantitatively diverse.

Russell in \cite{russell:core-affect} argues the labels such as ``fear",
``anger'', ``happiness'' do not capture this diversity. For instance, one might
say: a) a person being chased by an assailant brandishing a knife, b) a person
who retreats from an insect moving across the floor, and c) a person who is
concerned they will never find a career that is fulfilling are all in a state of
fear. On the basic emotions account, an emotional episode involves fixed
patterns of neurophysiological and facial expression changes in response to an
eliciting stimulus that are distinct between emotions, but are the same within
the same emotional category \cite{ekman:argument-emotions}. If this were the
case, one would expect that the three individuals described above would respond
to their eliciting stimuli in the same way, yet the similarity of behavioral
responses between these three cases seem unlikely. Dimensional theorists, in
contrast, would argue that the individuals in the above three cases are applying
the concept of fear to experience, despite the fact that each individual has a
unique core affect. While basic emotion theorists would hold that since all
three individuals are experiencing fear, they would perform the same behavioral
responses to the stimuli, dimensional theorists would argue this is not the
case, as each individual bears a core affective state that is distinguished from
the other two. For instance, the individual's arousal in response to an armed
assailant should be higher than the individual in response to an insect, as the
former case poses a threat to their life. As a result, the individual in the
first case would likely make every effort to escape from the assailant,
including trying to negotiate and plead with the assailant, while the individual
in the second case would be relatively less dedicated to escaping the insect. 

In sum, dimensional theory is compatible with the differences in the behavioral
responses to eliciting stimuli, while basic emotions theory only allows for a
single fixed behavior of responses to a given emotion. Furthermore, dimensional
theories can represent instances of basic emotions (see Figure
\ref{fig:dimensional-discrete}), for example, fear elicited by a snake (green
rectangle), in terms of variation along affective dimensions, i.e., arousal and
valence.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
  \center
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{figure/dimensional-discrete.png}
  \caption{Representing basic emotions within a dimensional framework
  \cite{hamann:mapping-discrete-dimensional}.}
  \label{fig:dimensional-discrete}
\end{figure}

Also, basic emotion theory fails to account for affect that lacks
object-directedness \cite{russell:core-affect}. In basic emotions approach, an
emotion is supposed to have an intentional object it is directed towards (e.g.,
being angry at someone, or being sad for someone). The dimensional theory argues
that emotion may not necessarily be aimed at a particular object. For instance,
an individual can experience a certain type of emotion (e.g., anger) without
knowing of anything in particular that has offended them. Dimensional models of
emotion are therefore capable of accounting for a wider range of affective
phenomena than basic emotions theory.

Another difference between dimensional and basic emotion theories is that the
basic emotion categorization of emotions captures facets of the experience of
an emotion not conveyed by the dimensional description, such as elicitation of a
facial expression of the emotion. In fact, this attribute of the basic
emotions theory is one of the major differnces with all other emotion theories.
As it is argued in basic emotion theory, basic emotions are hard-wired to their
corresponding facial expressions. Ekman who elaborated the concept of basic
emotions, developed the \textit{Facial Action Coding System} (FACS) which
encodes movements of individual facial muscles and it is a common standard to
systematically categorize the physical expression of emotions
\cite{ekman:facial-movement}.

\subsection{Appraisal Vs. Dimensional Emotions Theories}

Dimensional theories might suffer to adequately distinguish emotions because
of the existance of the limited dimensions.

To compare the appraisal and dimensional theories of emotion, we can argue that
there is a relationship between the dimensions in the constructivist or
dimensional theory of emotion and appraisal dimensions. For instance, the
pleasure dimension roughly maps onto appraisal dimensions that characterize the
valence of an appraisal-eliciting event (e.g., intrinsic pleasantness
--desirability--, or goal congruence), dominance roughly maps onto the appraisal
dimension of coping potential, and arousal can be considered as a measure of
intensity. However, they also have quite different meanings. Appraisal (as I
mentioned earlier) is a relational construct characterizing the relationship
between some specific object/event in the environment and the individual's
mentals constructs including beliefs, motives and intentions and several
appraisals may be simultaneously active; whereas emotions in dimensional emotion
theory are non-relational constructs, each summarizing a unique overall state of
the individual.

Furthermore, dimensional emotion theories emphasize different components of
emotion than appraisal theories and link these components quite differently.
In contrast to appraisal theories, dimensional emotion theories do not address
affect’s antecedents in detail. However, dimensional theorists question the
tight causal linkage between appraisal and emotion that is central to appraisal
accounts. As mentioned earlier, dimensional theorists believe that the emotion
is not necessarily about some object (as in ``I am angry \underline{at him}'').
In such theories, many factors may contribute to a change in emotion including
intentional judgments (e.g., appraisal). However, in dimensional emotion
theories the link between any preceding intentional meaning and emotion is
broken and most of the time can not be recovered correctly. For example, Russell
argues for the following sequence of emotional components: some external event
occurs (e.g., a bear walks out of the forest), it is perceived in terms of its
affective quality; this perception results in a cruicial change in core affect;
this change is attributed to some ``object" (e.g., the bear); and only then is
the object cognitively appraised in terms of its goal relevance, causal
antecedents and future prospects \cite{marsella:computational-models}.

We can also compare the dimensional emotion theories to OCC model as cognitive
appraisal model. The major similarity between these two models is that they both
consider emotions to descend from valenced reactions to the stimuli.
Furthermore, they acknowledge the role of arousal in determining emotional
reactions. As we mentioned in Section \ref{sec:dimensional-emotions} Russell
considered arousal as one of the two key dimensions of emotions which could be
used to partially discriminate emotional states
\cite{russell:circumplex-affect}. In a different manner, the OCC model
recognizes arousal as a necessary condition for eliciting emotions, and regards
the arousal as a major determinant of emotion’s intensity which distinguishes
among various emotions of a particular type (e.g., fearful and scared). In
\cite{scherer:what-emotions} Scherer speculates that arousal dimension in
dimensional models gives little information about the underlying appraisal of
the elicited emotion and he proposes to replace it with coping potential which
is an appraisal dimension referring to individual’s perceived control in a given
situation. 

Furthermore, models based on dimensional emotions theory pursue the idea of
eliciting an emotion according to the joint features in circumplex space (2D or
3D -- see Section \ref{sec:dimensional-emotions}) while OCC or other
models of appraisal theory are based on patterns of antecedent of emotions. This
is the fundamental difference between OCC, or appraisal theories in general, and the
circumplex approach of Russell \cite{russell:circumplex-affect} or Mehrabian's
PAD model \cite{mehrabian:pad,mehrabian-russell:pad}. Also, models based on
appraisal theory of emotion employ causation, attribution and eliciting
conditions in order to distinguish emotions while the eliciting conditions are
not directly accessible from dimensional approach. A dimensional model might
fall short in establishing why certain emotions are elicited. However, when the
objective is to identify the generated emotions and their level of pleasantness
and intensity, circumplex model brings about a perfect opportunity
\cite{ahmadpour:occ-dimensional-comparison}.

\end{figure}

Finally, here, I discuss how a model based on dimensional emotions theory
(i.e., Russell's 2D circumplex) relates to a cognitive model based on appraisal
theory (i.e., OCC model). Figure \ref{fig:occ-circumplex} shows the relationship
between Russell's circumplex and OCC model in terms of categorization of the
actual emotions. The number of emotions in a section of Russell's circumplex
that fall into an emotion group of OCC are shown in parentheses (see Figure
\ref{fig:occ-circumplex}). For instance, all three emotions on the top section
(highly excited, neutrally valenced emotions) fall into prospect based emotion
group, hence number (3) is indicated. Or, as another example, emotions in the
left section (neutral arousal value, negative valenced emotions) make a one to
one relationship between disappointment and prospect based emotion group,
contempt and attribution emotion group, and jealousy and fortune of others
emotion group, hence number (1) is indicated in fornt of each.

\section{Applications in Autonomous Agents and Robots}
\label{sec:applications}

There are several examples in artificial intelligence and robotics of applying
emotion theories such as appraisal theory
\cite{adam:bdi-emotional-companion,kim:model-hri-appraisal,
marsella:ema-process-model}. In \cite{sander:systems-approach-appraisal} authors
describe a system approach to appraisal processes based on Scherer's work on
appraisal and the Component Process Model (CPM)
\cite{scherer:nature-function-emotion}. They show how the temporal unfolding of
emotions can be experimentally tested. They lay out a general domain-independent
computational model of appraisal and coping.

Some researchers apply combination of emotion theories in thier work
\cite{kiryazov:modeling-appraisal-pad}. For instance, in
\cite{canamero:designing-activity-selection} Canamero shows how an agent can use
emotions for activity selection while taking into account both dimensional and
discrete appraches in an action selection mechanism. As another example, in PECS
\cite{urban:pecs} which is designed for modeling human behaviors, the
architecture is not based on a certain kind of social or psychological emotion
theory. In fact, it is intentionally designed and described in a way which
enables the integration of a variety of theories. In
\cite{miranda:teamwork-multiagent-system} the computational architecture is not
based any specific theory either.

Velasquez developed Cathexis which is a distributed comoputational model for
generation of emotions and their influence in the behavior of the autonomous
agents \cite{velasquez:emotions-motivations-agents}. The emotion model is based
on Roseman's work on appraisal theory.

In \cite{hudlicka:emotinos-reasons} Hudlicka provides a model of a generic
mechanism mediating the affective influeces on cognition based on cognitive
appraisal. This model is implemented within a domain-independent
cognitive-affective architecture (MAMAID).

Marinier and Laird in \cite{marinier:emotion-reinforcement} focus on the
functional benefits of emotion in a cognitive system. In this work, they
integrate their emotion theory (which is based on the appraisal theory) with
Soar cognitive architecture, and use emotional feedback to drive reinforcement
learning.

-Robots:

There are a variety of motivations behind modeling emotions for decades
\cite{wehrle:motivations-modeling-emotion}.

Different emotion theories are also used in robotic projects. In
\cite{kim:model-hri-appraisal} researchers provide their computational model
of emotion generation based on the appraisal theory.

We can see the applicaiton of emotion theories in designing companion robots and
robots capable of expressing emotions and social behaviors, and robots which can
convey certain types of emotion products, e.g., empathy
\cite{breazeal:expressive-behavior} 
\cite{leite:empathy-hri} \cite{paiva:emotion-modeling}
\cite{shayganfar:methodology}. Robots also use emotions theories for automatic
affect recognition using different modalities \cite{hegel:empathic-robot}
\cite{zeng:affect-recognition}. Other researchers have explored the user’s
affective state as a mechanism to adapt the robot’s behaviours
\cite{liu:affect-robot-behavior} \cite{breazeal:sociable-robot}.

In \cite{vogiatzis:robot-museum} researchers consider their robot's (INDIGO)
emotion, speech and facial expressions as a key point to establish an effective
communication between the robot and a human during ther interaction. They apply
concepts of appraisal theory in INDIGO's emotion modeling. MAGGIE, a sociable
robot, also applies the appraisal theory of emotions to consider fear in its
decision making system \cite{castro:autonomous-robot-fear}.

Researchers in \cite{lim:mei-motherese-ei} apply PAD's three-dimensional space
to rate the pleasure, arousal and dominance of their Multimodal Emotional
Intelligense robot (MEI) in each interaction with human subjects. Thier goal is
to introduce the first steps in MEI which can understand and express emotions in
voice, gesture and gait.

In the virtual agents community, empathy is a research topic that has received
much attention in the last decade \cite{paiva:agent-care}
\cite{prendinger:empathic-companion} \cite{bickmore:longterm-relationship}
\cite{brave:emotion-hci} \cite{scott:modeling-empathy-agent}. In
\cite{pontier:women-robot-men} researchers developed an agent with capability of
affective decision-making based on the appraisal theory to establish an
affective relationship with its users. Then, they comopared the performance of
their agent with human (based on a WoZ study) in a speed-dating experiment.

Models derived from appraisal theories of emotion, not surprisingly, emphasize
appraisal as the central process to be modeled. Computational appraisal models
often encode elaborate mechanisms for deriving appraisal variables such as
decision-theoretic plans \cite{gratch:domain-independent}
\cite{marsella:ema-process-model}, reactive plans
\cite{rank:appraisal-story-world} \cite{neal:modeling-antecedents}
\cite{staller:emotion-social-norm}, Markov-decision processes
\cite{elnasr:flame} \cite{si:modeling-appraisal-tom-journal}, or detailed
cognitive models \cite{marinier:behavior-emotion}. Emotion itself is often less
elaborately modeled. It is sometimes treated simply as a label (sometimes with
an intensity) to which behavior can be attached
\cite{elliott:affective-reasoner}. Appraisal is typically modeled as the cause
of emotion with specific emotion label being derived via if-then rules on a set
of appraisal variables. Some approaches make a distinction between a specific
emotion instance (allowing multiple instances to be derived from the same event)
and a more generalized ``affective state" or ``mood". Some more recent models
attempt to model the impact of momentary emotion and mood on the appraisal
process \cite{gebhard:alma}
\cite{gratch:domain-independent}
\cite{marsella:ema-process-model} \cite{paiva:learning-feeling}).

Computational appraisal models have been applied to a variety of uses including
contributions to psychology, AI and HCI. For example, Marsella and Gratch have
used EMA to generate specific predictions about how human subjects will appraise
and cope with emotional situations and argue that empirical tests of these
predictions have implications for psychological appraisal theory
\cite{gratch:assessing-appraisal} \cite{marsella:assessing-coping}. Several
authors have argued that appraisal processes would be required by any
intelligent agent that must operate in real-time, multi-agent environments
\cite{staller:emotion-social-norm} . The bulk of application of these
techniques, however, has been for HCI applications, primarily for the creation
of real-time interactive characters that exhibit emotions in order to make these
characters more compelling \cite{neal:believable-agents}, more realistic
\cite{mao:social-causality} \cite{traum:negotiation-teams-training}, more able
to understand human motivational state \cite{conati:evaluating-student-affect}
or more able to induce desirable social effects in human users
\cite{paiva:learning-feeling}.

Models influenced by dimensional theories, not surprisingly, emphasize processes
associated with core affect and other components (e.g., appraisal) tend to be
less elaborately developed. Core affect is typically represented as a continuous
time-varying process that is represented at a given period of time by a point in
3-space that is “pushed around” by eliciting events. Computational dimensional
models often have detailed mechanisms for how this point changes over time --
e.g., decay to some resting state -- and incorporating the impact of
dispositional tendencies such as personality or temperament \cite{gebhard:alma}.

Computational dimensional models are most often used for animated character
behavior generation, perhaps because it translates emotion into a small number
of continuous dimensions that can be readily mapped to continuous features of
behavior such as the spatial extent of a gesture. For example, PAD models
describe all behavior in terms of only three dimensions whereas modelers using
appraisal models must either associate behaviors with a larger number of
appraisal dimensions \cite{scherer:expression-appraisal}
\cite{smith:computational-facial-expression} or map appraisals into a small
number of discrete, though perhaps intensity-varying, expressions
\cite{elliott:affective-reasoner}. For a similar reason, dimensional models also
frequently used as a good representational framework for systems that attempt to
recognize human emotional behavior and there is some evidence that they may
better discriminate user affective states than approaches that rely on discrete
labels \cite{barrett:emotions-natural}.

The relationship between core affect and cognition is generally less explored in
dimensional approaches. Typically the connection between emotion-eliciting
events and current core-affective state is not maintained, consistent with
Russell’s view of emotion as a non-intentional state
\cite{becker:affect-primary-secondary}. Many computational models of emotion
that incorporate core affect have viewed appraisal as the mechanism that
initiates changes to core affect. For example Gebhard’s ALMA model
\cite{gebhard:alma} includes OCC inspired appraisal rules \cite{occ:structure}
and WASABI \cite{becker:wasabi} incorporates appraisal processes inspired by
Scherer’s sequential-checking theory into a PAD-based model of core affect. Some
computational models explore how core affect can influence cognitive processes.
For example, HOTCO 2 \cite{thagard:emotional-coherence} allows explanations to
be biased by dimensional affect.
